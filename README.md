This demo project was build using the gatsby-material starter

NOTE: Take a look at [gatsby-advanced-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) if you prefer building UI from scratch and/or only interested in fundamental features.

## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter
npm run serve
```
